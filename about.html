<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My passion for art and literature brought me to study English  in college... until, of course, I made the leap to data. </p>

<p>You can now find me devouring datasets to find the signals previously ignored and unappreciated. Experience has taught me that there is always a perspective to data that has not been explored. My goal is to uncover the truth behind the mysteries.</p>

<p>If you would like me to dig into the mysteries of your business, please feel free to send an email.</p>
